# Animations

This respository contains animations created by the Galacticnaut team. They leverage Python and PyGame to create the animations. May of the animations are used to supplement presentations and talks done by members of the team. Much of the code is developed with the aid of [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

Here is a full produced example of some of the components stitched together, it was used for a [Terminator 2: Judgement Day (Movie)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/) themed presentation.
